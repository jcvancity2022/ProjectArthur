						<h2>About Erickson</h2>
						<p>	Arthur Erickson, a Canadian architect, was known for his design philosophy of creating structures that seamlessly blended with their surroundings. Some of his notable works include the Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, Robson Square in British Columbia and MacMillan Bloedel Building in British Columbia.</p>
<p>
Erickson began his design process by carefully considering the genius loci of the site. Identical to the way space activates typography in graphic design, Erickson designed in such a way that the natural landscape activated his architecture.</p>
<p>
The projects of Erickson were fabricated with wood, glass, and stone — materials chosen carefully to complement the natural surroundings of the structure. What he considered the most important material was light. Erickson was known for using natural light in his designs to enhance the relationship between the building and its environment.
His third architectonic tenet was that of cadence, which he defined as the “rhythm set off by the spatial and structural system, stairs, landings, and window openings that complement one another through the building.” His usage of rhythm and cadence created harmony, enhancing the relationship between the indoor space and the natural landscape.
</p>
<p>
This made Arthur Erickson famous for being a tectonic poet.
</p>
<p>
Arthur Erickson's illustrious career spanned over four decades and had a significant impact on the field of architecture. His work has been recognized globally, and he has received numerous awards and honours for his contributions to the built environment.
