						<p>	Starship-House, also known as the Eppich House II, is a modernist masterpiece designed by renowned Arthur Erickson. This iconic residence, built in 1988, is located in West Vancouver. The house features an innovative design that resembles a spaceship, which is how it got its nickname.</p>
<p>
It is a striking example of Erickson's unique approach to architecture, combining natural elements with bold geometric forms. The house is constructed with extensive use of glass, steel, and concrete, blending seamlessly with its surrounding environment. The interior spaces are filled with natural light, and the floor-to-ceiling windows provide panoramic views of the landscape.</p>
<p>
One of the most distinctive features of the Starship-House is its curved roof, which appears to float above the main structure. This bold design element not only creates a visually stunning appearance but also serves a practical purpose, as it channels rainwater into a series of troughs that are integrated into the roof structure.</p>
<p>
Overall, the Starship-House is a testament to Arthur Erickson's architectural genius and his ability to create buildings that are both visually stunning and in harmony with the natural environment.
